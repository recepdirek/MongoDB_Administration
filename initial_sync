Initial Sync
Initial sync copies all the data from one member of the replica set to another member. A member uses initial sync when the member has no data, such as when the member is new, or when the member has data but is missing a history of the setâ€™s replication.

When you perform an initial sync, MongoDB:

Clones all databases. To clone, the mongod queries every collection in each source database and inserts all data into its own copies of these collections. At this time, _id indexes are also built. The clone process only copies valid data, omitting invalid documents.

Applies all changes to the data set. Using the oplog from the source, the mongod updates its data set to reflect the current state of the replica set.

Builds all indexes on all collections (except _id indexes, which were already completed).

When the mongod finishes building all index builds, the member can transition to a normal state, i.e. secondary.
