Upgrade Version Path
To upgrade an existing MongoDB deployment to 4.0, you must be running a 3.6-series release.

 

Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 4.0
The following 4.0 changes can affect the compatibility with older versions of MongoDB.

Compatibility Changes in MongoDB 4.0 — MongoDB Manual

Initial Syncs
Before starting the upgrade, ensure that no initial sync is in progress. Performing the upgrade while an initial sync is in progress will cause the initial sync to restart.

 

Feature Compatibility Version
The 3.6 replica set must have featureCompatibilityVersion set to 3.6.

db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )


if it is not set to 3.6, you must run the following command.

db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "3.6" } )

Replica Set Member State
Ensure that no replica set member is in ROLLBACK or RECOVERING state.

rs.status()

 

Upgrade Process
We are going to upgrade from MongoDB 3.6 to 4.0 using a “rolling” upgrade to minimize downtime by upgrading the members individually while the other members are available.

 

Manual Rolling Upgrade Steps for Replica Set
Upgrade Secondary Members of the Replica set:

 

1- list current mongodb binaries
dpkg -l | grep mongo


2- take backup of config file
cp mongod.conf /tmp/mongod.conf.org

 

3- stop the mongod secondary node
sudo service mongod stop

make sure mongo stopped

ubuntu@ip-172-31-10-90:~/tmp$ mongo

4- purge the existing mongodb binaries on secondary node
sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*

5- check if there is any mongodb binary on the server. You should not see any.
dpkg -l | grep mongo

 

6- Install MongoDB 4.0 version
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

 

 

7- copy original config file into its place
sudo mv mongod.conf.org /etc/mongod.conf

8- start the mongod instance
sudo systemctl start mongod

sudo systemctl status mongod

sudo systemctl enable mongod

sudo systemctl stop mongod

sudo systemctl restart mongod

 

9- Check the replica set status. 
rs.status()

10- Check the member if it’s version is 4.0
mongo --username root --password --authenticationDatabase admin --host ip-172-31-24-191 --port 27017


rs0:SECONDARY> db.version()
4.0.22
rs0:SECONDARY>

 

Upgrade Primary Member of the Replica set:

1- Step down the replica set primary
Connect a mongo shell to the primary and use rs.stepDown() to step down the primary and force an election of a new primary.


 

2- Check replica set status and new primary node is elected
rs.status()

3- stop the the ex primary node make sure db is not working
sudo service mongod stop


 

 

4- list current mongodb binaries
dpkg -l | grep mongo


5- take backup of config file
cp mongod.conf /tmp/mongod.conf.org

 

 

4- purge the existing mongodb binaries on secondary node
sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*

 

5- check if there is any mongodb binary on the server. You should not see any.
dpkg -l | grep mongo

 

6- Install MongoDB 4.0 version
wget -qO - https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.0.asc | sudo apt-key add -

echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.0.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org

 

 

7- copy original config file into its place
sudo mv mongod.conf.org /etc/mongod.conf

8- start the mongod instance
sudo systemctl start mongod

sudo systemctl status mongod

sudo systemctl enable mongod

sudo systemctl stop mongod

sudo systemctl restart mongod

 

9- Check the replica set status. 
rs.status()

10- Check the member if it’s version is 4.0
mongo --username root --password --authenticationDatabase admin --host ip-172-31-24-191 --port 27017


rs0:SECONDARY> db.version()
4.0.22
rs0:SECONDARY>

 

Enable backwards-incompatible 4.0 features.
At this point, you can run the 4.0 binaries without the 4.0 features that are incompatible with 3.6.

On the primary, run the setFeatureCompatibilityVersion command in the admin database:

copycopied


db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )
db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: "4.0" } )
